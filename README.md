# Inventory Management System (IMS)

## Project Overview

The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a RESTful web application built using **Spring Boot**, **Java 21**, and **MariaDB**. This system allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products in an inventory. It also includes global exception handling, unit testing with JUnit 5, and follows best practices in modern software development.

This system is designed to demonstrate software processes in an agile environment, showcasing important concepts such as REST API design, exception handling, and testing.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete products.
- **REST API**: Provides a simple REST API to interact with the inventory.
- **Exception Handling**: Global exception handler for clear and consistent error messages.
- **Unit Testing**: Test-driven development using JUnit 5.
- **Database**: Uses MariaDB for data persistence.
- **Agile Development**: Follows agile principles with iterative development and regular testing.
